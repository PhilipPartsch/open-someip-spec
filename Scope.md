# Scope - Open SOME/IP Specification

## 1. Purpose
This Working Group defines a compatibility profile and implementation guidance for the SOME/IP ecosystem to improve interoperability across OEMs, Tier‑1 suppliers and tool vendors. The Specification comprises the normative requirements described in detail in the documents held in this repository. References to external technologies are normative only to the extent they are described in detail in this Specification; elements merely referenced remain out of scope for patent coverage under this project.

## 2. In‑Scope
On‑wire message structure and service semantics necessary for interoperable SOME/IP communication; discovery and configuration behavior relevant to interoperability; error handling, timing requirements and conformance language; schemas, IDLs and message templates embedded as “Code Components” for illustration or testing.

## 3. Out‑of‑Scope
Reproduction of third‑party normative text; proprietary features not described here in detail; certification programs or marks; security infrastructure beyond requirements expressly covered; manufacturing methods and enabling technologies.

## 4. Patent Scope Clarification
Patent rights contributed to this project extend only to portions of the Specification that are required for conformance and are described in detail, including required elements of optional portions. They do not extend to technologies merely referenced. Rights apply only to Implementations that implement the Specification and all required portions.
